This was a test dedicated to a e-commerce website.

I tested different parts of the website that are : 

                Checking Sign Up Functionality
                Checking Sign In Functionality
                Search Functionality
                Addig Items to Cart
                Deleting Items from Cart
                Category Functionality 
                Checkout functionality
                Shop Now Button Functionality
 
 I used Selenium Java for testing where I made one pacakage and seperated different classes for each testing. 
 On the repository there will be an excel sheet with all the steps and potential bugs that were found.
